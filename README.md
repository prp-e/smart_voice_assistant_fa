# Smart Voice Assistant - Persian

This is a new voice assistant project I have started. This one, has to understand and respond to Persian words and sentences. This file is just a small _TODO_ list for me to come back and check unchecked tasks for the said project. 

## To-Do list

- [ ] Choosing a name for project
- [ ] Writing a response API (since it's a little bit hard to get _[Neural Intents](https://github.com/neuralnine/neuralintents)_ library to work on a Raspberry Pi)
- [ ] Modifing `mb-ir1` voice to sound better (Maybe a female voice, eh?)
- [ ] Writing a guide on how to have this voice assistant in your home.
